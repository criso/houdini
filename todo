- login with facebook

- Map
  - On Load 
    - we should get the user's location (browser)
    - a marker denoting the user's location should be placed  

  - Map Marker
    - on click 
      - should show info about users in that location

  - Friends on Map
    - place a marker cluster denoting the region/state with quantity of friends
      - Boston, would have a marker showing 5 friends in Boston

code

annoucing the users let's me know of everyone who is connected
which solves the "who's online" problem 
- on client side and check the ids of my friends
  and compare it to the annouced ids to know who's 
  online
