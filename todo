TDD
===============
- login with facebook

- Map
  - On Load 
    - we should get the user's location (browser)
    - a marker denoting the user's location should be placed  

    - Friends on Map
      - place a marker cluster denoting the region/state with quantity of friends
        - Boston, would have a marker showing 5 friends in Boston

  - Map Marker
    - on click 
      - should show info about users in that location

annoucing the users let's me know of everyone who is connected
which solves the "who's online" problem 
- on client side and check the ids of my friends
  and compare it to the annouced ids to know who's 
  online


- UserA and UserB are online
  - when userA places a pin (UserB can see the pin being placed)
    - show a box with: "What would you like to do here?"
      - this box is essentially a chat room now
        - UserA types a message (userB can see) 
      
when users come online
  - Place pin on map
    - Grow notifications on top right 

- On infoWindow - use:
  http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Drop
  open
    $(this.div_).show("drop", { direction: "down" }, 300);
  close
		$(this.div_).hide("drop", { direction: "up" }, dropTime);
